# GO-BUNYAN

`go-bunyan` is a `node-bunyan` compatible logger implementation written in Go1.2.

In short, this is a simple structured JSON logger. Logs outputs are JSON records that are
easy to further parse/query and mine. The format is inspired by the [node-bunyan][0] tool.
However the implementation and configuration is purely from the ground-up as Go1.2 is
obviously not JavaScript.

This thing is a work-in-progress, so expect some bugs and some missing features. But do
feel free to try it out and file bugs and feature requests.
